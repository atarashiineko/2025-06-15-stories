## 2025-06-16T01:14:33Z - Initial story creation

### Task Overview
Add project structure guidelines, create docs folder, index page, and first story about a JavaScript programming cat.

### Context
The repository previously contained only AGENTS.md and README.md. The user requested a new story stored under docs with an index linking to it and instructions captured in AGENTS.md.

### Thought Process
Followed existing directives to ensure tidy formatting and unique IDs. Generated random identifiers for each paragraph element and inserted HTML comments with the reasoning behind story choices.

### Chosen Solution
Update AGENTS.md with a Project Structure section. Generate index.html and javascript-cat.html under docs, ensuring tidy formatting and unique IDs. Include a chain of thought as HTML comments. Create log.md with this entry.

### Implementation
Installed tidy, added docs directory with index.html and javascript-cat.html, and appended the new project guidance to AGENTS.md.

### Impact Summary
The repository now contains a structured docs folder ready for GitHub Pages, a starting story about a JavaScript-loving cat, and a log for future updates.
