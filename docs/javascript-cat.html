  <title>The JavaScript Cat</title>

  <!-- Beginning of the story about a cat learning JavaScript. -->
  <main>
    <!-- Thought: Introduce the cat and its fascination with programming. -->
    <p id="para-ce1zn8qvzzw">Whiskers always watched humans tap away at their keyboards and
    wondered what secrets those symbols held. Determined to find out, the curious cat pawed through
    guides and found a language full of squiggly braces: JavaScript.</p>
    <!-- Thought: First mistake using print like Python, fix to console.log. -->
    <p id="para-lf7d1miibr7">Whiskers wrote a script to greet the world but typed
    <code>print('Hello')</code>. Nothing happened. After a moment of tail twitching, the cat
    realized JavaScript liked <code>console.log('Hello')</code> instead, and soon a message popped
    up.</p><!-- Thought: Mixing Python style with JavaScript for loops, fix syntax. -->
    <p id="para-p917wy2b3vh">Encouraged, Whiskers tried a loop. The cat wrote <code>for(let i = 0;
    i &lt; 3; i++):</code> and scratched its head at the error. Removing the colon solved the
    problem, letting the code run three happy times.</p>
    <!-- Thought: Asynchronous confusion, forgetting parentheses. -->
    <p id="para-7wl5ik3vx39">Next came a small adventure with asynchronous code. Whiskers forgot to
    call a function with parentheses and waited far too long for a promise to resolve. Once the cat
    added them back, the script purred along.</p>
    <!-- Thought: Summarize lessons and look forward to more coding. -->
    <p id="para-iais83ltslu">Mistakes aside, the determined feline loved each new discovery. With
    every bug fixed, Whiskers grew more confident that great adventures awaited in the world of
    JavaScript.</p>
