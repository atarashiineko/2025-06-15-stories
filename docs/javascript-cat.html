  <title>The JavaScript Cat</title>

  <!-- Beginning of the story about a cat learning JavaScript. -->
  <main>
    <!-- Thought: Expand on Whiskers rebellious nature and desire to forge its own path. -->
    <p id="para-3ya518g8fb5">Whiskers never cared for sleeping all day like other cats. From
    climbing off-limit shelves to sneaking into the neighbors garage, the feline chased thrills
    that kept everyone on their toes. The more rules Whiskers encountered, the more determined the
    cat became to break them.</p>
    <!-- Thought: Introduce the cat and its fascination with programming. -->
    <p id="para-ce1zn8qvzzw">Whiskers always watched humans tap away at their keyboards and
    wondered what secrets those symbols held. Determined to find out, the curious cat pawed through
    guides and found a language full of squiggly braces: JavaScript.</p>
    <!-- Thought: First mistake using print like Python, fix to console.log. -->
    <p id="para-lf7d1miibr7">Whiskers wrote a script to greet the world but typed
    <code>print('Hello')</code>. Nothing happened. After a moment of tail twitching, the cat
    realized JavaScript liked <code>console.log('Hello')</code> instead, and soon a message popped
    up.</p><!-- Thought: Mixing Python style with JavaScript for loops, fix syntax. -->
    <p id="para-p917wy2b3vh">Encouraged, Whiskers tried a loop. The cat wrote <code>for(let i = 0;
    i &lt; 3; i++):</code> and scratched its head at the error. Removing the colon solved the
    problem, letting the code run three happy times.</p>
    <!-- Thought: Asynchronous confusion, forgetting parentheses. -->
    <p id="para-7wl5ik3vx39">Next came a small adventure with asynchronous code. Whiskers forgot to
    call a function with parentheses and waited far too long for a promise to resolve. Once the cat
    added them back, the script purred along.</p>
    <!-- Thought: Summarize lessons and look forward to more coding. -->
    <p id="para-iais83ltslu">Mistakes aside, the determined feline loved each new discovery. With
    every bug fixed, Whiskers grew more confident that great adventures awaited in the world of
    JavaScript.</p>
    <!-- Thought: Show Whiskers defying expectations and entering the tech world. -->
    <p id="para-bfvcnw7mcwm">Refusing to settle for naps and window watching, Whiskers poured over
    online courses until even the neighbors dog looked impressed. The rebellious cat assembled a
    tiny workstation and marched into a startup, declaring a new career in software
    engineering.</p><!-- Thought: Illustrate the first day at the startup. -->
    <p id="para-to7q37jyfd2">At the office, Whiskers ignored the strange looks and immediately
    started coding in JavaScript. The cat experimented with asynchronous tricks that made the team
    nervous but also secretly impressed.</p>
    <!-- Thought: Show mistakes from ignoring coding guidelines. -->
    <p id="para-g593fg5ojkm">Emboldened by independence, Whiskers skipped the style guide and
    pushed changes that broke the build. The team groaned while the cat swished its tail,
    stubbornly convinced the code should just work.</p>
    <!-- Thought: Introduce searching the web for solutions. -->
    <p id="para-1lsepyul7tb">Rather than admit defeat, the feline opened the browser and scoured
    forums for answers. Late-night searches led to snippets explaining the exact error Whiskers
    kept seeing in the console.</p><!-- Thought: Show success from using community knowledge. -->
    <p id="para-ei33npcu85l">With fresh understanding, Whiskers refactored the code and finally saw
    the green build lights. The team watched in disbelief as the cat channeled online advice into a
    working feature.</p><!-- Thought: Summarize rebellious yet savvy approach. -->
    <p id="para-iviws2piwhf">Whiskers remained the rebellious soul of the office, but now the cat
    balanced bold ideas with quick research. Each problem turned into a chance to explore more of
    the JavaScript world.</p><!-- Thought: End first journey with reflection. -->
    <p id="para-trqw5bgtdxl">After a long day of victories and near disasters, Whiskers stretched
    across the keyboard, content. The cat knew tomorrow would bring more challenges, but it also
    promised a path shaped by personal choice and the endless resources of the internet.</p>
