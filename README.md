**FAILED**

I had to try this, but codex is not a writing model. It won't write text for you. The goal of this model is to complete tasks for you as fast as possible. This is clear when the code is working or not working, but text can be completed at any time, even when I tell create 10 pages... just optimized to 1 paragraph. Text always works from the technical perspective.
